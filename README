CIS501

A computer architecture simulation, containing: cache simulation, branch prediction and so on.
· Simulate an approximate model of a pipeline, with enough detail to capture the essence of the pipeline. Including scoreboard and load-to-use dependency.
· Model and explore the effectiveness of branch direction prediction (taken vs not taken) on an actual program(based on trace format). Including bimodal, gshare and tournament algorithm.
· Model and explore cache, and the optimal cache configuration, including way-number and cache size.
Superpipeline.
